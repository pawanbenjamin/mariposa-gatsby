          <p>
            Mariposa Wellness is an out-of-network outpatient physical therapy
            provider. This means that the client is responsible for paying the
            full fee at the time of service. We will issue a superbill that can
            be submitted by the client to their insurance for direct
            reimbursement. Each insurance company and plan is different. We
            recommend contacting your insurance company directly to find out
            what your coverage is for “outpatient physical therapy.”
